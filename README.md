### Abstract
This project investigates the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in predicting the mutagenicity of chemical compounds using the [MUTAG dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/graphs-datasets/MUTAG). We delve into various graph convolution layers, network architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and investigating the impact of incorporating both node and edge features.
